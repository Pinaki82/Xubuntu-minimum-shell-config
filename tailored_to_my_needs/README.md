## Less Interactive Instruction-Driven Package Installer Scripts

#### Directory:

`tailored_to_my_needs`

#### Files:

`personal_PSGupta_real_machine.sh`

`personal_PSGupta_vm.sh`

### NOTE:

The files in the folder `tailored_to_my_needs` are collections of instructions that I needed to configure a freshly installed Xubuntu Linux system. I aimed at making the process tidier on my part. I made the process mostly instruction-driven while installing packages. To me, installing programs will be 'tidier' only in the case when the process is less interactive and limitedly dependent on the user inputs. One of the scripts is an outcome of the efforts it took to install Xubuntu inside a VM, and the latter is a slight modification of the former. I spent a whole day. The requirements vary from one user to other. I discourage you to blindly run these scripts since you may not need what I need. However, the bash (bash shell only) scripts in this folder can be a good starting point to **study and modify** the instructions according to the requirements of a new 'X-L-K'-Ubuntu user. I strongly encourage you to make that changes to tailor your needs. You'll save time.

**NB:** Put the required installer shell-script in your `$HOME` (i.e., `~/`) directory first.
