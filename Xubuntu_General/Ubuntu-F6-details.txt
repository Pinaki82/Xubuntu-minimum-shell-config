acpi=off:
Disables ACPI, which is used for power management and actually
turning off power after the shutdown. This may help with compatibility
with motherboards which misuse ACPI.

Disables the "Advanced Configuration and Power Interface" or ACPI which is used
for power management in general (Fan speeds, sleep states...).
In some cases like running the installer from a Live USB or booting a laptop
it is needed for compatibility with the motherboard and how it
handles/mishandles ACPI.
Just in case you are wondering,
the difference between acpi=off and noacpi
is that acpi=... can accept more values.
For example acpit=force,irq.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
noapic:
Disables the "Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers" which is used to
resolve hardware conflicts for interrupts.
The effects of using a combination between noacpi and noapic depends
on the hardware. In some cases, disabling both will solve booting problems,
in others it will create problems.
Suggestions are that you try one at a time.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nolapic:
Very similar, but disables a different (newer) kind of APIC called a
LAPIC(Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller)

Disables the "Local Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller" which
applies to newer CPUs and they are handled.
nolapic is commonly used when you are using old hardware.
Many times even withnoapic`.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
edd=on:
Enables the EDD probe(Enhanced Disk Drive), used by motherboards to provide
more functionality to disk drives

Enables the "Enhanced Disk Drive" service which is used by VERY old motherboards
to provide support for hard drives,
specially ones that go beyond the 32GB barrier, which by todays standards
is like the size of a normal flash drive.
Anyway, if you have an old motherboard and a HDD bigger than 32GB,
then use edd=on.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nodmraid:
Disables dmraid which is used for RAID purposes but may cause empty disks to
appear even if they are fully partitioned, possibly with the wrong size.

Disables the "Device Mapper RAID" which is used for everything related to RAIDs.
Not recommended if you want to use RAIDs.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nomodeset:
Keeps the video driver from performing modesets which are used to bring the
graphics card to an enhanced state, but due to incompatibility,
may cause display issues.

Disables the video from using modesets which are used
for example for better resolutions and graphics.
If you are using an old video card, old monitor or both,
then activate this mode.
